  "summary": "Diff implements a photo-based input flow (upload + camera capture) on the Input & Payment screen, updates generation types/persistence to store the photo as the primary attempt input, blocks payment/generation when no photo is present, keeps the simulated 3–5s generation delay with placeholder output, updates Result screen to remove obsolete text metadata and optionally show the source photo, and adds new i18n keys for the new UI strings.",
