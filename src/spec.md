# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the “Continue with Google” button on the Auth (Login/Signup) screen open Gmail directly in a new tab, and deliver the full project source reflecting this change.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the AuthScreen “Continue with Google” button/link to point to https://mail.google.com instead of https://accounts.google.com/signup.
- Ensure the link opens in a new tab (target="_blank") and keeps rel="noopener noreferrer".
- Provide/export the complete, buildable project source code (frontend + backend), including required config/example files, with the Gmail-link change included.

**User-visible outcome:** Clicking “Continue with Google” on the login/signup screen opens Gmail (https://mail.google.com) in a new browser tab, and the full project source code is available as a complete buildable project.
